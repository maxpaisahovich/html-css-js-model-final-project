          The first Adloyada parade was initiated by Avraham Aldema, a teacher
          and co-founder of "Hevre Trasek", and was held in Tel Aviv during
          Purim in 1912. This parade was characterized by provocative costumes
          and pranks. According to several testimonies, the parade of 1912 was
          very colorful and beautiful. It consisted of giant puppets, a marching
          band and hundreds of children wearing their Purim costumes. Throughout
          the years, the parade became a permanent tradition of Purim. These
          events were held parallel to the famous celebrations that were
          organized by Baruch Agadati. Agadati's merriments had become extremely
          profitable, and so were criticized harshly by "Hevre Trasek" for being
          over commercialized. Tel Aviv's Adloyadas were complemented with
          luxurious Purim balls, created by Baruch Agadati. Throughout the
          years, the parades were expanded and their path was moved from Herzl
          Street to Allenby Street and to Ibn Gabirol Street upon the
          establishment of the state of Israel. During the 1930s, every Adloyada
          had a specific theme, for example the tribes of Israel (in 1934), and
          the achievements of the Yishuv. During that time, Tel Aviv's Purim
          events attracted many tourists from all around Israel and from abroad.
          As opposed to European states, where carnivals were a means to break
          loose and consisted of extreme licentiousness, aggressiveness and
          protest,[citation needed] the Tel Aviv event had different features.
          The main carnival, despite its new name Adloyada, was characterized by
          a "proper" behavior. The municipality issued annual limitations on the
          Purim celebrations such as a prohibition to use explosives and dress
          up in costumes that may offend the Jewish religion or the Israeli
          nation. Despite the censorship and the sanctions, there were a few
          costumes and parades that didn't obey the rules and used the public
          festivity to express social protest, and thus made their mark on the
          city. During the 1928 carnival, with the theme "10 years to the
          national home", Hevre Trasek presented a 10-candle Menorah (as a
          symbol to Balfour's statement); instead of candles there was a rude
          gesture and the sign "free Aliya, Jews in the top clerical work". In
          one of the "Menorah" balls (Menorah was a club founded by veterans) in
          1927, Avraham Atkind won the costume competition for his costume:
          "balancing the clerk's salary in the Palestine government". Atkind's
          hat had a scale and a photograph of the residence of the British
          commissioner in the magnificent Augusta Victoria building in Mount
          Scopus, as well as a poem, expressing the discontent of the gap
          between the British clerk's salary and the salaries of local Israelis
          from all ethnic groups. Gdud Meginei Hasafa (Hebrew: גדוד מגיני השפה,
          Battalion for the Defence of the Language), an organization in Tel
          Aviv fighting to make Hebrew the common language in Mandatory
          Palestine,[5][6] used Purim to present and to flood the streets with
          written propaganda. The Gdud documents were distributed during the
          Purim carnival. In addition, the Gdud held an annual costume
          competition with the theme of the superiority and importance of the
          Hebrew language. In the carnival of 1929, the Gdud presented the
          "tower of Babylon"; a tower on top of a horse-drawn cart with the
          slogan "revival of the language, revival of the people" and "words can
          kill". In the main carnival of 1933, there was a puppet of Hitler
          riding a horse, as part of the parade. On its neck there was a sign
          saying; "kill Jews" and next to it there were 2 Jews bleeding to
          death.

            class="about__historical-img-2"
          />The German consul in Jerusalem sent a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Meir
          Dizengoff in the matter and demanded an apology, but Dizengoff replied
          that Purim is a stage for free speech of public opinion. A year later,
          a huge puppet was presented with a swastika on its back. In 1935, a
          giant puppet was built, named "the profiteering monster". On the day
          of festivities, a public trial was held for the puppet, during which
          Dizengoff, Menachem Ussishkin, Chaim Weizmann and Yehoshua Hankin
          ruled that the monster was guilty of various crimes including fraud,
          spending the people's wealth, and destruction of the achievements of
          the pioneers. In one of the later carnivals, a group of people dressed
          as Ku Klux Klan members in order to protest racism in the United
          States. While Purim festivals became central public events in the
          1920s and 1930s for expressing current social issues, the holiday
          events, overall and despite exceptions, were aimed to strengthen
          national messages and dominant ideologies. As opposed to its Biblical
          origin, where Purim constitutes "an opposite world" (the fool becomes
          the king and the king is presented as a fool around town), in Tel Aviv
          the holiday was institutionalized to conserve the social hierarchy and
          the parades were led by the city's mayor Meir Dizengoff, astride a
          horse. During the Second World War, the Adloyada tradition was
          extinguished. The Adloyada tradition was renewed in the Purim of 1955.
          In the late sixties, the tradition disintegrated in Tel Aviv and the
          parade was transferred to Holon, although it lacked the unrefined
          feature of events in the small Tel Aviv. In the 80's an ArchiParhiTura
          (also spelled ArchiParchiTura; Hebrew: ארכיפרחיטורה) was introduced in
          Haifa. It was a Purim parade which had giant displays made by Technion
          architecture students ("ArchiParhiTura" is the Hebrew combination of
          the words architecture and "archi parhi"- which is the biblical
          expression of vagabond) and set on trucks. The parade went through
          Herzl Street in the Hadar Hacarmel area and was accompanied by an
          orchestra. In the last few years, an attempt was made to return to
          tradition and resume the Adloyada as an important main event in
          different cities. In the beginning, the parade was called "carnival".
          In 1923, a competition was held in order to find a new permanent name
          for the parade. Out of 300 submissions, author Isaac Dov Berkowitz's
          entry Adloyada was chosen. Adloyada means reaching a state of total
          intoxication. The expression comes from the Aramaic expression stated
          by Rabbah in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megilla: "It is the duty
          of a man to mellow himself ... on Purim until he cannot tell the
          difference between 'cursed be Haman' and 'blessed be Mordecai'."[3]
          This means that people should drink on Purim until he reaches a state
          of not being able to distinguish between the evil Haman and the
          blessed Mordecai. Among the other submitted suggestions were Hayim
          Nahman Bialik's entry "Pura", Tchernichovsky's entry "Astoret" and
          Avraham Shlonsky's entry "Tzahalula".
